# Tree Root Modeling for Mechanical Analysis

## Abstract
This work developed a software for modeling tree roots for mechanical analysis. It generates 3D solids with geometries based on biological parameters of trees found on nature. Four morphological patterns were implemented for automatic generation. The tree is then imported automatically in a finite elements software.

## Introduction
Storms, erosions and other natural phenomena can damage the integrity of forests and isolated trees, affecting natural coverage and compromising the safety of buildings and people. The undertanding of the mechanisms of tree anchorage on soils can help avoid its uproot when undergoing these adversities [1].
